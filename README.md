# Student-Performance-Analyzer

## Description 
This program is built in python using basic concepts of loop and conditional statements without using advanced data structures or functions.The aim is to create a program that analyzes the students performance based on the internal assessment marks.The marks of multiple students are taken. Each student's marks are checked and given as Excellent, very good, good, average and fail based on their performance. Marks are taken in between 0 and 100 only (inclusive).This program also counts the number of students who have passed the examination and the number of students failed the examination. And also, the personalized logic is used based on the users own details, which changes the output.

## Feautures 
-Takes student marks as input
-Classifies marks into:
  -Excellent
  -Very Good
  -Good
  -Average
  -Fail
  Invalid
-Counts:
  -Total number of students passed
  -Total number of students failed
-Implements a personalized condition based on name and section to modify marks for one or more selected categories

## Constraints followed 
- Uses only single for loop, conditional statements, strings and basic variables
- No dictionaries or sets are used
- No min(), max(), sum() are used
- No try-except is used

## How to Run 
1. Open the file main.py
2. Run the program in python
3. Enter the details that has been asked and check the student performance along with the updated marks after applying the personalized logic.

## Learning Outcomes
From this challenge, I have learned how to use loops when multiple inputs are given and how the conditional statements are implemented. I also learned how to implement personalized logic using my own details so that we came to know, how small logic can change logic or output. 
During this challenge, I used strings to store and check details such as name and section. I understood how string operations like checking length and comparing values can be used in conditions to control the program. 
It helped me to understand the importance of writing the code in a structured manner using basic concepts. Overall, this challenge improved my understanding of basic python concepts.
